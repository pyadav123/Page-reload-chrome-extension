The Page Reload Chrome Extension automatically refreshes your current tab at fixed intervals (10, 20, 30 seconds, or 1 minute). It auto-stops after one reload, with a "Stop Reloading" button for manual control. Easy to use with a simple popup interface, perfect for monitoring dynamic content without manual refreshing.
